    <p> Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made with layers of pasta, rich meat or vegetable sauce, creamy béchamel or ricotta cheese, and melted cheese on top. Each layer is baked to perfection, creating a hearty and flavorful meal with a soft, yet slightly crispy texture. It is commonly prepared with ground beef or sausage in a tomato-based sauce, though vegetarian versions with spinach or mushrooms are also popular. The dish is known for its comforting, indulgent taste and is often enjoyed as a main course. Lasagna is versatile, with variations across different regions and families, but always remains a crowd favorite.
