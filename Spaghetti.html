    <p>Spaghetti Aglio e Olio is a simple yet delicious Italian pasta dish made with just a few ingredients: spaghetti, garlic, olive oil, red pepper flakes, and parsley. This dish is known for its bold flavors, with the garlic sautéed in olive oil creating a fragrant base that coats the spaghetti perfectly. Traditionally served as a quick meal, it's both satisfying and comforting. With a touch of heat from the red pepper flakes, this dish is a favorite for those who enjoy a bit of spice. It's versatile enough to be enjoyed on its own or paired with various sides.</p>

        <li>Spaghetti (about 12 oz)</li>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
